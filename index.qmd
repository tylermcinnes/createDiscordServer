## Discord for community support

Discord servers are a useful way to connect and support a community. This may be a long-term community (*e.g.,* storing onboarding documents, hosting regular meetups, advertising events) or a transient community (*e.g.,* during a conference or event).

The aim of this document is to provide some guidance on creating a discord server for the purpose of community support. We will assume no prior knowledge of discord. 

This is by no means exhaustive and I recommend you do further research on specific topics like **permissions** before using a server for a major event.
